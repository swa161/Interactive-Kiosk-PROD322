Veliky Novgorod

Veliky Novgorod, also known as Novgorod the Great, or Novgorod Veliky, or just Novgorod (meaning "newtown"), is one of the oldest historic cities of Russia, with more than 1,000 years of history. The city serves as the administrative center of Novgorod Oblast. 

The city lies along the Volkhov River just downstream from its outflow from Lake Ilmen and is situated on the M10 federal highway connecting Moscow and Saint Petersburg. UNESCO recognized Novgorod as a World Heritage Site in 1992. The city has a population of 218,717â€‰(2010 Census);

At its peak during the 14th century, the city was the capital of the Novgorod Republic and was one of Europe's largest cities. The "Veliky" ("great") part was eventually added to the city's name to differentiate it from another city with a similar name, Nizhny Novgorod ("lower newtown").
